##### This is a <% if (namespace) {%><%= namespace + '/'%><%}%><%= componentName %> React component documentation template

Documentation will be displayed in the component options dialog which you can open in Structor workspace.

So, if there is some notes worth to remember, like descriptions of available props in component, place them here.

**Please find file to edit in: `.structor/docs/components`**
