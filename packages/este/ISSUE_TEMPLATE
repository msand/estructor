Have a usage question?
======================
The issue tracker isn't the best place for usage questions. This format is not well-suited for Q&A, and questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

- Read the docs: https://github.com/este/este#documentation
- Explore Este: https://este.firebaseapp.com/
- Look for/ask questions on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=este
- Ask in chat: https://gitter.im/este/este

Think you found a bug?
======================
The best bug report is a failing test in the repository as a pull request. Otherwise, please use the "BUG REPORT" template below.

Have a feature request?
=======================
Remove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.
